- 👋 Hi, my name is Mateus, I'm a technology student and I dream of being a front-end programmer.
- 👀 At the moment I'm interested in getting my first job opportunity in the area, I'm studying and working on projects to strengthen my knowledge every day and be prepared for whatever comes my way.
- 🌱 I'm currently focused on learning front-end programming languages, such as JavaScript, React, Node and also TypeScript. I have good knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate in different areas focused on programming, I consider myself an agile person, and consistent in adapting to any change to gain experience.
